it creates skeletons and backups

This WILL damage files if you are not careful

basically, it will take all files in a directory, and copy them to a second directory, after each file is done being copied, it will replace the original wioth a 0kb version of itself, useful for some very specific things, i made it for myself, but i figured someone might need it, i use it for ingesting mass amounts of media while keeping the original files so the names wont get mixed
